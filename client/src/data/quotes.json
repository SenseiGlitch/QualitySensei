  "If you don't have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?",
  "Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding.",
  "Software testing is not about finding bugs, it's about delivering quality software.",
  "Quality is not an act, it is a habit.",
  "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.",
  "A good tester finds problems early before they become expensive.",
  "The more you test, the more confidence you can have in your software."
